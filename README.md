ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @KingJames0000 ðŸ‘‹

I'm currently at Louisiana Tech University studying Electrical Engineering.

I enjoy learning about circuit design, writing software, CAD and 3D printing, etc..  I prefer writing C, but I also have experience in C++ and python.  I've also done VHDL.

When I'm not in the lab or class, I enjoy getting out in God's incredible Creation!  I'm an avid cyclist, I hunt and fish, swim, whatevery catches my fancy.  I do my own auto maintenance, both the small fixes and major teardowns.  I also dabble playing guitar.

I have come to prefer Linux to Windows for everything possible.  I currently use Debian testing or Manjaro with Plasma Desktop.  Though challenging at first, I now have Linux working quite well on my convertible laptop, with pen and multitouch gestures.  I'm currently in the process of installing Gentoo, also with KDE, in the hopes of optimizing everything for speed and efficiency for my hardware.
